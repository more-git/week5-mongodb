                            Cat communication is the transfer of information by one or more cats that has an effect on
                            the current or future behaviour of another animal, including humans. Cats use
                            a range of communication modalities including vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory.
                            The communication modalities used by domestic cats have been affected by domestication.</p>

                        <p>Cats use their claws to catch small prey. In the book, "The Domestic Cat: The Biology of Its Behaviour"
                            It's said that Humans have lived with cats for thousands of years, and there are now more cats kept in
                            Western households than any other animal. Cats are cherished companions.
                            Their enigmatic behavior has intrigued and bewildered us for generations.
                            While accepting the comforts of human homes, cats do seem to "walk by themselves."
                            Although loved for their independence and self-reliance, myths and fables surround them,
                            leaving them open to persecution and misunderstanding.

                        <h1>Cool Cat</h1>
                        <p>This cat's name is Charles.
                            Some cats rub their faces on humans, apparently as a friendly greeting or indicating affection.
                            This tactile action is combined with olfactory communication as the contact leaves scent
                            from glands located around the mouth and cheeks. Cats also sometimes "head-bump" humans
                            or other cats with the front part of the head; this action is referred to as "bunting"
                            Again this communication might have an olfactory component as there are scent glands in this
                            area of the body, and is possibly for seeking attention when the cat turns their head down
                            or to the side while doing so.
                            Head-bumping and cheek rubbing may be displays of social dominance as they are often exhibited
                            by a dominant cat towards a subordinate.
                            Touching noses, sometimes referred to as "sniffing noses", is a friendly, tactile greeting for cats.</p>
